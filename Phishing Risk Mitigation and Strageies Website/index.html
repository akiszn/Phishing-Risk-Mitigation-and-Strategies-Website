									<h2><a href="#">What is<br />
									Phishing?</a></h2>
									<p>Phishing attacks, a significant threat to higher education institutions, 
										compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and potentially lead to financial losses. 
										Despite increasing awareness efforts, university personnel remain vulnerable to these attacks. </p>
								</header>
								
								<header>
									<h2>Phishing</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Among cyber threats, phishing remains a leading attack method. It is a
									deceptive tactic used by cybercriminals to steal personal information. A cybercriminal creates a site by masquerading as a reputable source with
									an enticing request to lure the victim to trick them, just like how a fisherman uses a
									bait to catch a fish.</p>
									<br/>
									<br/>

									<header>
										<h2> How does Phishing work? </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Phishing works by luring a victim with legitimate-looking (but fraudulent) emails or other 
										communication from a trusted (or sometimes seemingly desperate) sender who coaxes victims 
										into providing confidential informationâ€”often on what looks to be a convincingly legitimate website. 
										Sometimes malware or ransomware is also downloaded onto the victim's computer.</p>
										<br/>
										<br/>

									<header>
										<h2>Are there any reported accidents of Phishing attacks in Higher Education?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Higher education institutions are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, 
										with phishing being a leading cause of data breaches that expose sensitive 
										information and result in costly consequences (Fouad, 2021)<a href="references.html">[1]</a>. For instance, 
										a phishing attack at Lancaster University compromised the data of students, faculty, staff, and 
										applicants, this highlights the vulnerability of academic institutions (Tripwire, 2019)<a href="references.html">[2]</a> <br/>
										In the Philippines, 
										similar incidents have occurred, such as the breach at Romblon State University in 2024 and the University of 
										the East in 2019, which exposed the personal data of students and alumni. Additionally, a vulnerability in the 
										Philippine education ministry's system put over 210,000 records at risk (Dancel, 2024)<a href="references.html">[3]</a>, while Viettel Threat 
										Intelligence (2024) reported over 315,000 compromised credentials across universities. These incidents highlight the urgent need for 
										effective mitigation strategies to enhance phishing awareness and data security in educational institutions.</p>
										<br/>

										<h2>Are there any existing framework and principles regarding Phishing Awareness in PUPQC?</h2>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Despite growing awareness of cybersecurity threats, fewer efforts focus on human-centric 
												strategies that address the behavioral and awareness gaps among end-users (Naqvi et al., 2023). 
												This gap is particularly concerning for institutions like the Polytechnic University of the 
												Philippines Quezon City (PUPQC), where personnel are highly vulnerable to phishing due to the 
												absence of cybersecurity training programs, heavy reliance on email communication, and frequent 
												use of digital tools and the Internet for data exchange. <br/>
												This study examined the phishing awareness of PUPQC personnel, focusing on a human-centric 
												approach to safeguard sensitive academic and personal data. It aimed in  assessing their awareness 
												levels and behavioral responses to phishing attempts, with the goal of developing a tailored 
												phishing risk mitigation strategy that addresses the specific needs of PUPQC personnel.</p>

									<p> Figure 1. Human-Centric Phishing Risk Mitigation Framework </p>
								</header>
								<p>In today's digital landscape, phishing remains one of the most prevalent and dangerous cyber threats, exploiting human vulnerabilities rather than just technological gaps. Our Human-Centric Phishing Risk Mitigation Framework is designed to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to recognize, respond to, and recover from phishing attacks effectively.

									By focusing on identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery, this framework integrates personalized training, gamified learning, real-time alerts, and a strong support system to create a resilient cybersecurity culture.
